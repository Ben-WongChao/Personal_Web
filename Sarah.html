                <div>
                  <p>Don't know if your products or data visualizations are accessible? What's needed to move in a more inclusive direction? How to become WCAG compliant?</p>
      <p>I can do a detailed or high-level <strong>accessibility review</strong>, and based on the outcomes suggest fixes and next steps. Often this also includes building internal <strong>accessibility documentation &amp; guidelines</strong>.</p>

                  <p>I'm a front-end, design and accessibility cross-breed. This means I build products and websites that are <strong>user friendly</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong>.</p>
      <p>I'm open for ongoing front-end consulting, standalone projects, and accessibility engineering. I can independently build accessible websites and prototypes, make accessibility improvements to existing products, or work embedded in a team building the front-end for new features.</p>

                <div>
                  <p>I build good looking, user-friendly, responsive and accessible <strong>websites</strong>, <strong>blogs</strong>, and <strong>interfaces</strong>. I can run the process from start to finish, and often design directly with code.</p>
      <p>I enjoy challenges involving different ways of working and visualising data and content, and have a lot of fun writing <strong>creative css</strong> (eg. creating photorealistic CSS drawings).</p>
      <p>Fun fact: I've been writing HTML/CSS since I was 10 ✨.</p>
